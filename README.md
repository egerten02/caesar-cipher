# caesar-cipher

The Caesar cipher is a simple encryption technique. It's a type of substitution cipher. Each letter of a given text is replaced by a letter with a fixed number of positions down the alphabet. For example with a shift of 1, 'A' would be replaced by 'B', 'B' would become 'C', and so on. The method is named after Julius Caesar.
